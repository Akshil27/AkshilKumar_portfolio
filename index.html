                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome! I’m Akshil Kumar, a recent M.S. graduate in Industrial Technology and
                    Manufacturing with a passion for business intelligence and supply‑chain analytics.
                    My story began in the trenches of operations where I learned that spreadsheets and
                    schedules are only the beginning of a supply chain’s narrative. Over the years I’ve
                    built SQL pipelines, dashboards and forecasting models that cut reporting time by
                    <strong>80&nbsp;percent</strong>, prevented more than <strong>$285K</strong> in losses and
                    reduced financial risk by <strong>$250K per year</strong>. More importantly,
                    these projects taught me how to listen to stakeholders, translate their needs into
                    meaningful metrics and tell clear stories with data. Through my graduate studies at
                    Purdue University Fort Wayne, I explored predictive modelling and systems thinking,
                    culminating in a directive project that integrated inventory forecasting and
                    bottleneck detection. I invite you to explore the sections below to see how these
                    experiences shape my approach to analytics.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a strategic and resourceful analyst with over three years of experience in B2B operations
            analytics, SQL and business intelligence. My passion lies in leveraging data to solve complex
            problems and drive operational excellence. Over the course of my career I’ve cut reporting time by
            <strong>80%</strong>, prevented more than <strong>$285K</strong> in forecast‑related losses and reduced
            annual financial risk by <strong>$250K</strong> through predictive analytics. I enjoy translating
            business requirements into scalable KPI dashboards and models, managing large datasets and
            collaborating with cross‑functional teams to deliver customer‑focused, data‑driven solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before pursuing my master’s degree in Industrial Technology and Manufacturing, I spent several
            years in the trenches of business operations—optimising budgets, streamlining workflows and
            uncovering hidden patterns in massive spreadsheets. That hands‑on experience taught me that
            manufacturing and supply chains are living systems that need both strategic oversight and
            real‑time insight. My graduate studies built on that foundation by exposing me to modern
            production systems and predictive modelling techniques. I applied those skills in my directive
            project, where I designed an integrated inventory forecasting and bottleneck detection framework
            for a simulated factory. The project sparked my fascination with storytelling through data and
            reinforced my commitment to building analytical tools that empower decision‑makers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics and professional roles, I’ve built cross‑cultural teams and volunteered
            in community workshops on digital literacy. These experiences taught me the value of empathy,
            adaptability and clear communication—qualities that translate directly to stakeholder
            engagement and project success. I’m eager to collaborate with organisations that want to
            transform their operations through data storytelling and human‑centric design, using
            technology as a bridge between insights and impact.

        <h2>My Philosophy &amp; Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Data analysis, for me, is as much about people as it is about numbers. Early in my career I
            learned that a successful dashboard isn’t just a set of charts—it’s a narrative that
            resonates with the audience. My philosophy is to begin every project by understanding
            the stakeholder’s story: What decision are they trying to make? What pain points are
            they experiencing? Only then can I craft solutions that truly matter. I strive to
            balance technical rigour with empathy, ensuring that insights are both accurate and
            actionable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my journey I’ve discovered the power of ownership and continuous
            improvement. I like to think of projects as partnerships: I take responsibility for
            shepherding ideas from exploratory analysis through implementation, keeping open lines
            of communication along the way. I constantly challenge myself to simplify complex
            processes, automate repetitive tasks and explore new techniques. Curiosity drives me
            forward—whether that’s learning a new visualisation tool or diving into an unfamiliar
            dataset. This mindset helps me adapt quickly and deliver solutions that evolve with
            changing business needs.

        <h2>Directive Project: Prosacco Supply&nbsp;Chain Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my master’s directive project, I analysed a simulated supply chain for a hypothetical
            firm called Prosacco. The goal was to integrate inventory forecasting with bottleneck detection
            using predictive analytics. The underlying datasets (Orders, Forecasting and Customer reports)
            came from the Unilever Supply Chain Management &amp; Analytics program and were used strictly for
            educational purposes. The figures below summarise key insights from the analysis.
