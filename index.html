                <p>
                    Hello! I’m Akshil Kumar, a recent M.S. graduate in Industrial Technology and
                    Manufacturing who is deeply interested in business intelligence and supply chain
                    analytics. Through my graduate studies and professional experience, I’ve honed my
                    ability to transform operational data into actionable insights. I specialise in
                    designing forecasting models, building interactive dashboards and identifying process
                    bottlenecks across complex supply chains. My work has cut reporting time by
                    80&nbsp;percent, prevented over $285K in forecast‑related losses and reduced financial risk by
                    $250K per year. I’m passionate about using data storytelling to drive informed
                    decisions and delight stakeholders.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a strategic and resourceful analyst with over three years of experience in B2B operations
            analytics, SQL and business intelligence. My passion lies in leveraging data to solve complex
            problems and drive operational excellence. Over the course of my career I’ve cut reporting time by
            80%, prevented more than $285K in forecast‑related losses and reduced annual financial risk by
            $250K through predictive analytics. I enjoy translating business requirements into scalable KPI
            dashboards and models, managing large datasets and collaborating with cross‑functional teams to
            deliver customer‑focused, data‑driven solutions.

        <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of merely repeating Amazon’s Leadership Principles, I’ve woven them into my own
            professional philosophy. These guiding themes shape how I approach analytics projects,
            collaborate with teammates and drive impact across the supply chain. Here’s how I bring
            them to life in my work:
        </p>
        <ul class="leadership-list">
            <li><strong>Customer Obsession:</strong> I always start with the needs of internal and
                external customers when designing data solutions. My dashboards and models focus on
                answering the right questions so that end users are delighted and empowered.</li>
            <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> I take full responsibility for projects from data
                modelling through implementation and follow‑up. When challenges arise, I lean in,
                communicate transparently and proactively seek improvements rather than waiting for
                direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Invent &amp; Simplify:</strong> I look for creative ways to simplify complex
                processes. Whether designing an automated report or a forecasting algorithm, I
                challenge assumptions and build intuitive tools that make decision‑making easy for
                stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn &amp; Be Curious:</strong> I continuously expand my skill set—be it
                exploring new BI platforms, studying emerging supply chain trends or experimenting
                with predictive models. This curiosity helps me stay ahead of the curve and bring
                fresh perspectives to each problem.</li>

        <h2>Directive Project: Prosacco Supply&nbsp;Chain Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my master’s directive project, I analysed a simulated supply chain for a hypothetical
            firm called Prosacco. The goal was to integrate inventory forecasting with bottleneck detection
            using predictive analytics. The underlying datasets (Orders, Forecasting and Customer reports)
            came from the Unilever Supply Chain Management &amp; Analytics program and were used strictly for
            educational purposes. The figures below summarise key insights from the analysis.
